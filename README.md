# Baseball-WAR-Predictions
AI-Driven Prediction of Baseball Player Performance (WAR)
Project Overview
In this project, we aim to predict future season statistics for baseball players, specifically focusing on Wins Above Replacement (WAR), a comprehensive metric evaluating a player's overall contribution to their team. WAR is an advanced baseball statistic that measures a player's value in the game. It calculates how many more wins he's worth than a replacement-level player in a similar position. The project involves downloading and cleaning baseball season data (MLB), selecting predictive features, and building a ridge regression model for accurate WAR prediction.

At the end of the project, we will have a functional machine learning model capable of predicting WAR for the upcoming season, along with insights and next steps to refine the model further.
